Lab1: Use the Student Management System Database and table from previous lab.Perform the following commands on the table Student and Enrollment. 

1. Let's consider a scenario where you have a database tracking student enrollments and some students may not be enrolled in any courses. John Doe (StudentID: 1) is enrolled in courses with EnrollmentIDs 101 and 102. Jane Smith (StudentID: 2) is enrolled in courses with EnrollmentIDs 103 and 104. Bob Johnson (StudentID: 3) is not enrolled in any courses. Now,run RIGHT OUTER JOIN query to retrieve data. 



2. Assume a university where students can enroll in various courses. Here are some fictional details: Student Information: Student with ID

 1: John, email: john@email.com Student with ID 2: Jane, email: jane@email.com Student with ID 3: Bob, email: bob@email.com Enrollment Information: Enrollment with ID 101: John (StudentID: 1) enrolls in Math (CourseID: MATH101). Enrollment with ID 102: John (StudentID: 1) enrolls in History (CourseID: HIST201). Enrollment with ID 103: Jane (StudentID: 2) enrolls in Physics (CourseID: PHYS301). Enrollment with ID 104: Bob (StudentID: 3) enrolls in Chemistry (CourseID: CHEM401). Enrollment with ID 105: Alice (StudentID: 4) enrolls in English (CourseID: ENG501). Now, write a LEFT JOIN query to retrieve the data.


CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID)
);

INSERT INTO Enrollment VALUES
(101, 1, 'MATH101'),
(102, 1, 'HIST201'),
(103, 2, 'PHYS301'),
(104, 2, 'CHEM401'),
(105, 4, 'ENG501');

SELECT Student.StudentID, Student.FirstName, Student.LastName, Enrollment.EnrollmentID, Enrollment.CourseID
FROM Student 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN Enrollment 
ON Student.StudentID = Enrollment.StudentID;

SELECT Student.StudentID, Student.FirstName, Student.Email, Enrollment.EnrollmentID, Enrollment.CourseID
FROM Student 
LEFT JOIN Enrollment 
ON Student.StudentID = Enrollment.StudentID;
