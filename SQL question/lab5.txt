1. Let's consider a scenario where you want to retrieve information about students from a database table named student and display the results in ascending order based on their last names. 

Hint: Use orderBy clause in a ascending Order

SELECT * FROM Student  
ORDER BY lastName ASC;

2. Let's consider a scenario where you want to count the number of students based on their gender from a database table named Student.

 Hint: use GroupBy clause and Count() function

SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS total_students  
FROM Student  
GROUP BY gender;
